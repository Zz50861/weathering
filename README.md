# weathering
This project contains the code accompanying the manuscript "Enhanced Texture-Synthesis-Based Weathering Effects Simulation from a Single Image."

To view the weathering effects, you can directly run the weathering.py script, ensuring that the file paths remain unchanged. The tools directory provides various codes related to texture processing, while the process.py script is used for calculating the degree map, shading map, and origin texture.

If you need further information or assistance to run these codes, please feel free to ask. Additionally, it is recommended to review any provided documentation or comments before running the scripts to ensure the environment is correctly configured and to understand the functionality of each component.
