# weathering
This project contains the code accompanying the manuscript "Enhanced texture-synthesis-based weathering effects simulation:from a single image: incorporating control lines and original texture features."

To quickly view the weathering effects, you can directly run the _weathering.py_. The _tools_ directory provides various codes related to texture processing, while the _process.py_ is used for calculating the degree map, shading map, and origin texture.

If you need further information or assistance to run these codes, please feel free to ask. Additionally, it is recommended to review any provided documentation or comments before running the scripts to ensure the environment is correctly configured and to understand the functionality of each component.
